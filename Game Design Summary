---------- Game Design Overview ----------

"People call you a con artist. You think that sounds overly sinister, but you can't really 
disagree. Ever since you were young, you've never been satisfied with the way things are." 


Level 1: You're in a hospital, impersonating a new resident.

Why are you there? What is your goal?

Obviously you want to avoid being outed as a fraud and pass off as a real doctor.

You also want to... 
1. Access the medical records of an important patient (promising)
	- Are they your enemy?    
	- Are they your friend?
	- Maybe they are totally unrelated; In a coma after being poisoned by your enemy/after a crazy adventure with your missing friend or lover
	- Need to find out what's wrong with them to get more info about your friend/enemy's wherabouts. (ate a rare berry, stung by a tropical insect, etc)
    	- You need to impress the attending working on this important patient
		  - You do this by successfully treating patients
 

2. Impress a cute pharmaceutical rep (sidequest)
