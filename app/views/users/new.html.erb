      <h2>Ka-bash'd: A Natural Language Game Framework</h2>
      <p>Ka-bash’d is a natural language, game creation framework with valuable applications in training and learning. Games created in Ka-bash’d allow players to use their own words to control game play. IBM Watson, specifically the Watson Engagement Advisor (WEA), interprets user input as in-game commands. IBM Watson is also available in the traditional question answering context via a gametime companion that provides related data on request. The initial game is a medical game where a player must examine, interact, diagnose, and give treatment options to patients. Ka-bash’d includes an extensible API that allows easy creation of game scenarios that each provide unique skill-building opportunities to players.</p>

    <p>The Ka-bash’d team is interested in finding a unique way to use, maximize, and present IBM Watson through an interactive game platform. The game platform should progress using commands offered by the user and should have more than one sequence of commands which result in game completion. Ka-bash’d uses IBM Watson to understand natural language in two different ways. The first of which, disambiguates user input as commands and the second takes user input and provides factual answers. </p>

    <p>Further, the Ka-bash’d team is intrigued with the idea of personality combined with technology. As such, IBM Watson, to the user, is not only a source for asking questions but also a personal companion to the user.</p>

  <div class="col-md-6">
    <p>Finally, the Ka-bash’d team is determined to make this platform expandable and adaptable to people who have game scenarios of their own to share. Ka-bash’d should be used not only with the game levels presently offered, but as a framework to easily add your own game story to play along to and share amongst friends.</p>
